Neural networks don't process raw data, like text files, encoded `JPEG` image files, or `CSV` files. They process vectorized & standardized representations.

- Text files need to be read into string tensors, then split into words. Finally, the words need to be indexed & turned into integer tensors.
- Images need to be read and decoded into integer tensors, then converted to floating point and normalized to small values (usually between 0 and 1).
- `CSV` data needs to be parsed, with numerical features converted to floating point tensors and categorical features indexed and converted to integer tensors. Then each feature typically needs to be normalized to zero-mean and unit-variance.

If you have a large dataset and you are training on GPU(s), consider using Dataset objects, since they will take care of performance-critical details, such as:

- Asynchronously preprocessing your data on CPU while your GPU is busy, and buffering it into a queue.
- Prefetching data on GPU memory so it's immediately available when the GPU has finished processing the previous batch, so you can reach full GPU utilization.

`Keras` models accept three types of inputs:

- `NumPy` arrays. This is a good option if your data fits in memory.
- `TensorFlow` Dataset objects. This is a high-performance option that is more suitable for datasets that do not fit in memory and that are streamed from disk or from a distributed file system.
- Python generators that yield batches of data 

Some preprocessing layers have a state:

- `TextVectorization` holds an index mapping words or tokens to integer indices
- `Normalization` holds the mean and variance of your features

The state of a preprocessing layer is obtained by calling `layer.adapt(data)` on a sample of the training data

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Normalization

training_data = np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(64, 200, 200, 3)).astype("float32")
normalizer = Normalization(axis=-1)
normalizer.adapt(training_data)
normalized_data = normalizer(training_data)
```

you start by specifying the shape (and optionally the dtype) of your inputs. If any dimension of your input can vary, you can specify it as `None`.

```python
# Let's say we expect our inputs to be RGB images of arbitrary size
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(None, None, 3))
```

An important feature of Keras is **callbacks**, configured in `fit()`. Callbacks are objects that get called by the model at different point during training, in particular:

- At the beginning and end of each batch
- At the beginning and end of each epoch

```python
callbacks = [
    keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
        filepath='path/to/my/model_{epoch}',
        save_freq='epoch')
]
model.fit(dataset, epochs=2, callbacks=callbacks)
```

To use TensorBoard with `fit()`, simply pass a `keras.callbacks.TensorBoard` callback specifying the directory where to store TensorBoard logs:

```python
callbacks = [
    keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir='./logs')
]
model.fit(dataset, epochs=2, callbacks=callbacks)
```

```
tensorboard --logdir=./logs
```



By default, `fit()` is configured for **supervised learning**. If you need a different kind of training loop (for instance, a GAN training loop), you can provide your own implementation of the `Model.train_step()` method. This is the method that is repeatedly called during `fit()`.

```python
class CustomModel(keras.Model):
  def train_step(self, data):
    # Unpack the data. Its structure depends on your model and
    # on what you pass to `fit()`.
    x, y = data
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      y_pred = self(x, training=True)  # Forward pass
      # Compute the loss value
      # (the loss function is configured in `compile()`)
      loss = self.compiled_loss(y, y_pred,
                                regularization_losses=self.losses)
    # Compute gradients
    trainable_vars = self.trainable_variables
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, trainable_vars)
    # Update weights
    self.optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, trainable_vars))
    # Update metrics (includes the metric that tracks the loss)
    self.compiled_metrics.update_state(y, y_pred)
    # Return a dict mapping metric names to current value
    return {m.name: m.result() for m in self.metrics}

# Construct and compile an instance of CustomModel
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(32,))
outputs = keras.layers.Dense(1)(inputs)
model = CustomModel(inputs, outputs)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=[...])

# Just use `fit` as usual
model.fit(dataset, epochs=3, callbacks=...)
```

If you have multiple GPUs on your machine, you can train your model on all of them by:

- Creating a tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy object
- Building & compiling your model inside the strategy's scope
- Calling fit() and evaluate() on a dataset as usual

```python
# Create a MirroredStrategy.
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

# Open a strategy scope.
with strategy.scope():
  # Everything that creates variables should be under the strategy scope.
  # In general this is only model construction & `compile()`.
  model = Model(...)
  model.compile(...)

# Train the model on all available devices.
train_dataset, val_dataset, test_dataset = get_dataset()
model.fit(train_dataset, epochs=2, validation_data=val_dataset)

# Test the model on all available devices.
model.evaluate(test_dataset)
```





With asynchronous preprocessing, your preprocessing operations will run on CPU, and the preprocessed samples will be buffered into a queue while your GPU is busy with previous batch of data. The next batch of preprocessed samples will then be fetched from the queue to the GPU memory right before the GPU becomes available again (prefetching). This ensures that preprocessing will not be blocking and that your GPU can run at full utilization.

To do asynchronous preprocessing, simply use `dataset.map` to inject a preprocessing operation into your data pipeline

```python
# Example training data, of dtype `string`.
samples = np.array([["This is the 1st sample."], ["And here's the 2nd sample."]])
labels = [[0], [1]]

# Prepare a TextVectorization layer.
vectorizer = TextVectorization(output_mode="int")
vectorizer.adapt(samples)

# Asynchronous preprocessing: the text vectorization is part of the tf.data pipeline.
# First, create a dataset
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((samples, labels)).batch(2)
# Apply text vectorization to the samples
dataset = dataset.map(lambda x, y: (vectorizer(x), y))
# Prefetch with a buffer size of 2 batches
dataset = dataset.prefetch(2)

# Our model should expect sequences of integers as inputs
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(None,), dtype="int64")
x = layers.Embedding(input_dim=10, output_dim=32)(inputs)
outputs = layers.Dense(1)(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs, outputs)

model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="mse", run_eagerly=True)
model.fit(dataset)
```

When training text models on CPU, you will generally not see any performance difference between the two setups. When training on GPU, however, doing asynchronous buffered preprocessing on the host CPU while the GPU is running the model itself can result in a significant speedup.



TensorFlow is an infrastructure layer for differentiable programming. At its heart, it's a framework for manipulating N-dimensional arrays (tensors), much like NumPy.

However, there are three key differences between NumPy and TensorFlow:

- TensorFlow can leverage hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs.
- TensorFlow can automatically compute the gradient of arbitrary differentiable tensor expressions.
- TensorFlow computation can be distributed to large numbers of devices on a single machine, and large number of machines (potentially with multiple devices each).

Variables are special tensors used to store mutable state (such as the weights of a neural network). 

```python
initial_value = tf.random.normal(shape=(2, 2))
a = tf.Variable(initial_value)
```

You update the value of a `Variable` by using the methods `.assign(value)`, `.assign_add(increment)`, or `.assign_sub(decrement)`

Just open a `GradientTape`, start "watching" a tensor via `tape.watch()`, and compose a differentiable expression using this tensor as input

```python
a = tf.random.normal(shape=(2, 2))
b = tf.random.normal(shape=(2, 2))

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(a)  # Start recording the history of operations applied to `a`
    c = tf.sqrt(tf.square(a) + tf.square(b))  # Do some math using `a`
    # What's the gradient of `c` with respect to `a`?
    dc_da = tape.gradient(c, a)
    print(dc_da)
```

By default, variables are watched automatically, so you don't need to manually `watch` them:

```python
a = tf.Variable(a)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    c = tf.sqrt(tf.square(a) + tf.square(b))
    dc_da = tape.gradient(c, a)
    print(dc_da)
```

Note that you can compute higher-order derivatives by nesting tapes

```python
with tf.GradientTape() as outer_tape:
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        c = tf.sqrt(tf.square(a) + tf.square(b))
        dc_da = tape.gradient(c, a)
    d2c_da2 = outer_tape.gradient(dc_da, a)
```

 A `Layer` encapsulates a state (weights) and some computation (defined in the call method). The weight variables (created in `__init__`) are automatically tracked under the `weights` property:

The `self.add_weight()` method gives you a shortcut for creating weights:

```python
class Linear(keras.layers.Layer):
    """y = w.x + b"""

    def __init__(self, units=32):
        super(Linear, self).__init__()
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(
            shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
            initializer="random_normal",
            trainable=True,
        )
        self.b = self.add_weight(
            shape=(self.units,), initializer="random_normal", trainable=True
        )

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b


# Instantiate our lazy layer.
linear_layer = Linear(4)

# This will also call `build(input_shape)` and create the weights.
y = linear_layer(tf.ones((2, 2)))
```

You can automatically retrieve the gradients of the weights of a layer by calling it inside a `GradientTape`. 

```python
# Prepare a dataset.
(x_train, y_train), _ = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(
    (x_train.reshape(60000, 784).astype("float32") / 255, y_train)
)
dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=1024).batch(64)

# Instantiate our linear layer (defined above) with 10 units.
linear_layer = Linear(10)

# Instantiate a logistic loss function that expects integer targets.
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)

# Instantiate an optimizer.
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=1e-3)

# Iterate over the batches of the dataset.
for step, (x, y) in enumerate(dataset):

    # Open a GradientTape.
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:

        # Forward pass.
        logits = linear_layer(x)

        # Loss value for this batch.
        loss = loss_fn(y, logits)

    # Get gradients of the loss wrt the weights.
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, linear_layer.trainable_weights)

    # Update the weights of our linear layer.
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, linear_layer.trainable_weights))

    # Logging.
    if step % 100 == 0:
        print("Step:", step, "Loss:", float(loss))
```

Weights created by layers can be either trainable or non-trainable. They're exposed in `trainable_weights` and `non_trainable_weights` respectively

```
class ComputeSum(keras.layers.Layer):
    """Returns the sum of the inputs."""

    def __init__(self, input_dim):
        super(ComputeSum, self).__init__()
        # Create a non-trainable weight.
        self.total = tf.Variable(initial_value=tf.zeros((input_dim,)), trainable=False)

    def call(self, inputs):
        self.total.assign_add(tf.reduce_sum(inputs, axis=0))
        return self.total
```

Layers can be recursively nested to create bigger computation blocks. Each layer will track the weights of its sublayers (both trainable and non-trainable).

```
class MLP(keras.layers.Layer):
    """Simple stack of Linear layers."""

    def __init__(self):
        super(MLP, self).__init__()
        self.linear_1 = Linear(32)
        self.linear_2 = Linear(32)
        self.linear_3 = Linear(10)

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.linear_1(inputs)
        x = tf.nn.relu(x)
        x = self.linear_2(x)
        x = tf.nn.relu(x)
        return self.linear_3(x)
        
mlp = MLP()

# The first call to the `mlp` object will create the weights.
y = mlp(tf.ones(shape=(3, 64)))

# Weights are recursively tracked.
assert len(mlp.weights) == 6
```

Layers can create losses during the forward pass via the `add_loss()` method. This is especially useful for regularization losses. The losses created by sublayers are recursively tracked by the parent layers.

```python
class ActivityRegularization(keras.layers.Layer):
    """Layer that creates an activity sparsity regularization loss."""

    def __init__(self, rate=1e-2):
        super(ActivityRegularization, self).__init__()
        self.rate = rate

    def call(self, inputs):
        # We use `add_loss` to create a regularization loss
        # that depends on the inputs.
        self.add_loss(self.rate * tf.reduce_sum(inputs))
        return inputs
```

Any model incorporating this layer will track this regularization loss

```
class SparseMLP(keras.layers.Layer):
    """Stack of Linear layers with a sparsity regularization loss."""

    def __init__(self):
        super(SparseMLP, self).__init__()
        self.linear_1 = Linear(32)
        self.regularization = ActivityRegularization(1e-2)
        self.linear_3 = Linear(10)

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.linear_1(inputs)
        x = tf.nn.relu(x)
        x = self.regularization(x)
        return self.linear_3(x)


mlp = SparseMLP()
y = mlp(tf.ones((10, 10)))

print(mlp.losses)  # List containing one float32 scalar
```

These losses are cleared by the top-level layer at the start of each forward pass -- they don't accumulate. `layer.losses` always contains only the losses created during the last forward pass. You would typically use these losses by summing them before computing your gradients when writing a training loop.

```python
# Losses correspond to the *last* forward pass.
mlp = SparseMLP()
mlp(tf.ones((10, 10)))
assert len(mlp.losses) == 1
mlp(tf.ones((10, 10)))
assert len(mlp.losses) == 1  # No accumulation.

# Let's demonstrate how to use these losses in a training loop.

# Prepare a dataset.
(x_train, y_train), _ = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(
    (x_train.reshape(60000, 784).astype("float32") / 255, y_train)
)
dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=1024).batch(64)

# A new MLP.
mlp = SparseMLP()

# Loss and optimizer.
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=1e-3)

for step, (x, y) in enumerate(dataset):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:

        # Forward pass.
        logits = mlp(x)

        # External loss value for this batch.
        loss = loss_fn(y, logits)

        # Add the losses created during the forward pass.
        loss += sum(mlp.losses)

        # Get gradients of the loss wrt the weights.
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, mlp.trainable_weights)

    # Update the weights of our linear layer.
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, mlp.trainable_weights))

    # Logging.
    if step % 100 == 0:
        print("Step:", step, "Loss:", float(loss))
```

To use a metric in a custom training loop, you would:

- Instantiate the metric object, e.g. `metric = tf.keras.metrics.AUC()`
- Call its `metric.udpate_state(targets, predictions)` method for each batch of data
- Query its result via `metric.result()`
- Reset the metric's state at the end of an epoch or at the start of an evaluation via `metric.reset_states()`

```python
accuracy = tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy()

# Prepare our layer, loss, and optimizer.
model = keras.Sequential(
    [
        keras.layers.Dense(32, activation="relu"),
        keras.layers.Dense(32, activation="relu"),
        keras.layers.Dense(10),
    ]
)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-3)

for epoch in range(2):
    # Iterate over the batches of a dataset.
    for step, (x, y) in enumerate(dataset):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            logits = model(x)
            # Compute the loss value for this batch.
            loss_value = loss_fn(y, logits)

        # Update the state of the `accuracy` metric.
        accuracy.update_state(y, logits)

        # Update the weights of the model to minimize the loss value.
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss_value, model.trainable_weights)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_weights))

        # Logging the current accuracy value so far.
        if step % 200 == 0:
            print("Epoch:", epoch, "Step:", step)
            print("Total running accuracy so far: %.3f" % accuracy.result())

    # Reset the metric's state at the end of an epoch
    accuracy.reset_states()
```

Running eagerly is great for debugging, but you will get better performance by compiling your computation into static graphs. Static graphs are a researcher's best friends. You can compile any function by wrapping it in a tf.function decorator.

```python
# Prepare our layer, loss, and optimizer.
model = keras.Sequential(
    [
        keras.layers.Dense(32, activation="relu"),
        keras.layers.Dense(32, activation="relu"),
        keras.layers.Dense(10),
    ]
)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-3)

# Create a training step function.


@tf.function  # Make it fast.
def train_on_batch(x, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        logits = model(x)
        loss = loss_fn(y, logits)
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_weights)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_weights))
    return loss


# Prepare a dataset.
(x_train, y_train), _ = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(
    (x_train.reshape(60000, 784).astype("float32") / 255, y_train)
)
dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=1024).batch(64)

for step, (x, y) in enumerate(dataset):
    loss = train_on_batch(x, y)
    if step % 100 == 0:
        print("Step:", step, "Loss:", float(loss))
```

Some layers, in particular the BatchNormalization layer and the Dropout layer, have different behaviors during training and inference. For such layers, it is standard practice to expose a training (boolean) argument in the call method.

By exposing this argument in call, you enable the built-in training and evaluation loops (e.g. fit) to correctly use the layer in training and inference modes.

```python
class Dropout(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, rate):
        super(Dropout, self).__init__()
        self.rate = rate

    def call(self, inputs, training=None):
        if training:
            return tf.nn.dropout(inputs, rate=self.rate)
        return inputs


class MLPWithDropout(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MLPWithDropout, self).__init__()
        self.linear_1 = Linear(32)
        self.dropout = Dropout(0.5)
        self.linear_3 = Linear(10)

    def call(self, inputs, training=None):
        x = self.linear_1(inputs)
        x = tf.nn.relu(x)
        x = self.dropout(x, training=training)
        return self.linear_3(x)


mlp = MLPWithDropout()
y_train = mlp(tf.ones((2, 2)), training=True)
y_test = mlp(tf.ones((2, 2)), training=False)
```

Here are some of the things you've learned so far:

- A Layer encapsulates a state (created in __init__ or build) and some computation (defined in call).
- Layers can be recursively nested to create new, bigger computation blocks.
- You can easily write highly hackable training loops by opening a GradientTape, calling your model inside the tape's scope, then retrieving gradients and applying them via an optimizer.
- You can speed up your training loops using the @tf.function decorator.
- Layers can create and track losses (typically regularization losses) via self.add_loss().
